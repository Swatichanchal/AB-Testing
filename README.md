# AB-Testing

## Analyze A/B Test Results
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Review Solution 
2 specifications changed according to the 1st review .
1. If there is an interaction between page and country to see if there significant effects on conversion. so you need to create additional interaction columns .fit a model again with the new columns ,provide results and put your conclusion according to obtained results .
2. Conclusions should include not only statistical reasoning, but also practical reasoning for the situation.
